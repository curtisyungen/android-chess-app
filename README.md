# android-chess-app

This is the first application I've created in Java and Android. It is a single-player chess board that conforms to all of the rules of a standard Chess game including proper piece movement, piece capture, castling the king, pawn promotion to queen, check, and checkmate. 

The main Java files are in /app/src/main/java/com/example/chessapp/.
